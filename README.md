A simple C++ program which displays a class roster on the terminal and performs a few functions which makes changes to the roster.

### Project Takeaways
**C++ OOP**: First plunge into using object oriented design principles to create clean and organized code. 
  * Uses **polymorphism** to describe how a student can have different characteristics depending on their major.
* Uses **inheritence** by having general characteristics of students (such as name and ID) be passed on to students of specific majors (ex: networking student inherits name and ID attributes from student class).
* Uses **encapsulation** to shields code for a particular class from other code not within the class (utilizes private and public methods and attributes).
* Uses **abstraction** to show only details and functionalities necessary to the user. Hides implementaiton details.
